WARNING: [DRC CFGBVS-1] Missing CFGBVS and CONFIG_VOLTAGE Design Properties: Neither the CFGBVS nor CONFIG_VOLTAGE voltage property is set in the current_design.  Configuration bank voltage select (CFGBVS) must be set to VCCO or GND, and CONFIG_VOLTAGE must be set to the correct configuration voltage, in order to determine the I/O voltage support for the pins in bank 0.  It is suggested to specify these either using the 'Edit Device Properties' function in the GUI or directly in the XDC file using the following syntax:

 set_property CFGBVS value1 [current_design]
 #where value1 is either VCCO or GND

 set_property CONFIG_VOLTAGE value2 [current_design]
 #where value2 is the voltage provided to configuration bank 0

Refer to the device configuration user guide for more information.

WARNING: [DRC DPOP-2] MREG Output pipelining: DSP ats/rgb_reg4__20 multiplier stage ats/rgb_reg4__20/P[47:0] is not pipelined (MREG=0). Pipelining the multiplier function will improve performance and will save significant power so it is suggested whenever possible to fully pipeline this function.  If this multiplier was inferred, it is suggested to describe an additional register stage after this function.

WARNING: [DRC PDRC-153] Gated clock check: Net vga_sync_unit/p_tick is a gated clock net sourced by a combinational pin vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1/O, cell vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1. This is not good design practice and will likely impact performance. For SLICE registers, for example, use the CE pin to control the loading of data.
WARNING: [DRC PLHOLDVIO-2] Non-Optimal connections which could lead to hold violations: A LUT vga_sync_unit/h_count_reg[9]_i_1 is driving clock pin of 5 cells. This could lead to large hold time violations. Involved cells are:
ats/newpic_reg, ats/rgb_reg_reg[11], ats/rgb_reg_reg[3], ats/rgb_reg_reg[7], and ls/rgb_reg_reg[7]
